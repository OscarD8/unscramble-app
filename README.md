# unscramble-app 

A simple word game built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** in Android Studio. The app presents users with scrambled words that they need to rearrange correctly.

## Features  
- Randomly scrambled words for each round  
- Input validation to check correct answers  
- Score tracking
- Basic UI built with Android components  
- Includes **unit tests** for core game logic  

## Tech Stack  
- Kotlin  
- Android Studio  
- JUnit for testing  

## Motivation  
This project was built as part of my journey learning Android development (Android Basics with Compose). It helped me practice app structure, state management, material theme, and implementing simple testable game logic.
